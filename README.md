# Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier + Stylelint

A starter for React with Typescript with the Vite with Eslint and formatting
with Prettier and Stylelint.

This starter template is based on
[this template](https://github.com/TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier)
that I found in the [Awesome Vite repo](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite).
I specifically added Stylelint to the project and plan on updating this repo as
needed over time. You can find more about these in the following links:
[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/),
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `npm start`
